## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or newer)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- Git
- A Supabase account and project

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FleetTrackPigs/fleet-track.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd fleet-track
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend (`server/`):**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env
    # !!! Important: Edit the .env file with your Supabase URL, anon key, and other secrets !!!
    # Example .env content:
    # SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    # SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    # PORT=3001 # Or any other port you prefer
    npm run dev # Starts the backend server in development mode
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend (`client/` or root `/`):**
    (Open a new terminal window or tab in the project root directory)
    ```bash
    # Assuming frontend is in the root directory
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env # If you have frontend-specific env vars
    # !!! Edit .env if needed, e.g., VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api !!!
    npm run dev # Starts the frontend development server (usually on port 8080)
    ```

Now you should have the backend running (e.g., on `http://localhost:3001`) and the frontend accessible (e.g., at `http://localhost:8080`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the `server` directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the `dist` directory.
3.  Start the production server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the root project directory (where the frontend `package.json` is):
    ```bash
    # If you are in the server directory:
    cd ..
    # Or just navigate to the project root
    ```
2.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder in the root directory with the optimized static assets ready for deployment.
